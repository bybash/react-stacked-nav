A stacked navigation or drawer for React JS Apps. I needed a similiar behaviour of [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html) library in React Js Web applications, so I created this basic component.
Notice that it is not a finished library but you can use it for your purposes.
You can download source code and run commands `npm i && npm start` to run example app

It uses latest react-hooks, so besure about your react version.
It is light-weighted and dependencies are: [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

Features
* Open a side drawer width desired width
* Open new drawers over drawers
* Open a new drawer from every place of your code
* Push new drawers to navigation and pop back
* Close all stacked navigation by clicking overlay (optional)

TO-DO:
- [ ] Make it an npm package
- [ ] Write a how to use documentation
- [ ] Navigation direction support (right now only from right)
- [ ] Injectable back, header and footer components
